This is a manual on how to change a little the original functionality of ImSAnE
by introducing asymmetric export of onion layers (when producing embedded charts).

First step: Change the source of the ImSAnE
1) locate instalation of ImSAnE, it is a folder in which "+diffgeometry", "+project" and more are listed
2) open prompt/command line/console and 'cd' into it
3) call: cp SurfaceOfInterest.m SurfaceOfInterest__BACKUP.m 
4) call: patch -p 1 < path_to_this_repository/1_exportFromImSAnE/0_patch

This sequence should create a backup of all modified files (in fact, only 1 file is modified).
It should upgrade/change the file +surfaceAnalysis/@SurfaceOfInterest/SurfaceOfInterest.m ,
which should become similar to the 0_surfaceAnalysis_SurfaceOfInterest_SurfaceOfInterest.m
from this repository.


Second step: Use the upgrade ImSAnE
1) open/install and use ImSAnE as usual (you don't need to close the current session of Matlab!)
2) modify the commands:

onionOpts = struct('nLayers', 3, 'layerDistance', 2, 'sigma', 20,'makeIP' ,'MIP');
xp.SOI.pullbackStack(xp.stack, xp.currentROI, xp.currentTime, onionOpts);

in your pipeline to the new commands:

onionOpts = struct('nLayersP', 8, 'nLayersM', 5, 'layerDistance', 2, 'sigma', 20,'makeIP' ,'MIP');
xp.SOI.pullbackStack(xp.stack, xp.currentROI, xp.currentTime, onionOpts);

3) re-run your pipeline from this place

Notice that 'nLayers' was replaced with a pair 'nLayersP' and 'nLayersM'.
This sequence should export your charts as usual except that 8 p-layers and 5 m-layers are created,
instead of the original 3 additional p-layers and 3 m-layers. When this pair of parameters
is used, the intensity projection parameter 'makeIP' is not applied and no addition projections
are created (you may still find projection folders on your harddisk, these will be from your
previous attempts, note their timestamps).
