Please, install this "enhanced" VolumeManager to your Fiji instalation.
This can be achieved by replacing the VolumeManager*.jar file inside
the 'plugins' folder with this file. Restart Fiji.

- in Fiji, open VolumeManager (SCF -> ...), you don't need to open any image
- go File -> Import from disc, and point it at your .zip file with the ROIs
- go File -> Export -> Save current volume to text files and point it to
  a folder, where __ROIcoords.txt files shall appear
- you can close Fiji now

- in Matlab, navigate to the folder where is the SOI.xml file
- open the Proper_length_from_Fiji.m and edit the section with parameters
- execute the script, or its pieces
